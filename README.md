# ExpenseTrack

A personal finance management web application developed.

Live Demo: [ExpenseTrack](https://expense-management-lake.vercel.app/)

## About

I built ExpenseTrack to solve the common challenge of managing personal finances effectively. As a student, I wanted to create something practical that could help track daily expenses while learning modern web development technologies.

The application offers an intuitive interface for recording expenses, visualizing spending patterns, and maintaining better control over personal finances. I focused on making it responsive and user-friendly across all devices.

## Core Features

- **Smart Dashboard**: Get quick insights into your spending with summary cards and charts
- **Easy Expense Tracking**: Add and manage expenses with detailed categorization
- **Visual Reports**: Understand your spending patterns through interactive charts
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Choose your preferred theme for comfortable viewing

## Built With

I used these technologies to build ExpenseTrack:

- React 18 with TypeScript for robust frontend development
- Tailwind CSS for responsive styling
- React Router for navigation
- React Hook Form for form handling
- Recharts for data visualization
- Local storage for data persistence
